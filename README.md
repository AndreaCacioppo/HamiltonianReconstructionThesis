# Hamiltonian Reconstruction

This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the results presented in the Master's thesis "Deep learning for the parameter estimation of tight-binding Hamiltonians" by Andrea Cacioppo, available at ...

## Abstract 

The code available at this repository implements an algorithm whose purpose is the recovery of the Hamiltonian of a crystal in the tight-binding approximation given its electronic bands. The class of Hamiltonians which can currently be recovered is represented by the matrix
## Getting Started

To get the running code clone or download the repository into your local computer

### Prerequisites

T

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
