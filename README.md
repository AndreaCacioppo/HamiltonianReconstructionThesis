# Hamiltonian Reconstruction

This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the results presented in the Master's thesis "Deep learning for the parameter estimation of tight-binding Hamiltonians" by Andrea Cacioppo, available at ...

## Abstract 

The code available at this repository implements an algorithm whose purpose is the recovery of the Hamiltonian of a crystal in the tight-binding approximation given its electronic bands. The class of Hamiltonians which can currently be recovered is represented by the matrix

The electronic bands are synthetically generated by taking the eigenvalues of this matrix.

## Getting Started

To get the running code clone or download the repository into your local computer.

### Prerequisites

Python and pyTorch and TensorboardX need to be installed.

## Structure of the code

The main file is called 1d.py while the tunable hyperparameters are contained in CustomModules/Parameters.py (these are the only two files needed to be modified running a test).

## Running the tests

In order to recover the parameters of an artificial Hamiltonian: 

- In 1d.py under "Dataset creation" set the values of the artificial Hamiltonian parameters (for example e1_true = 2.). This Hamiltonian will be used to compute the synthetic electronic bands from which the algorithm will try to recover the hamiltonian parameters. 
- In CustomModules/Parameters.py the hyperparameters of the algorithm can be changed (a good choice is learning_rate = [0.005], batch_sizes = [16], n_hidden_neurons = [35], regularization_parameters = [0], ratios = [2], it is possible to loop over these parameters, for example with learning_rates = [1, 2, 3, 4]).
- In order to read the obtained Hamiltonian parameters and the training procedure run on a terminal: tensorboard --logdir /path/HamiltoninReconstructionThesis/Tensorboard1d and open the indicated link in a browser to see the results.
